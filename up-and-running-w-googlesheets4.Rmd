## What's this?

Given the new(ish), major releases of [**{googledrive}**](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/) and [**{googlesheets4}**](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) (see Jenny Bryan's release posts for [googledrive 2.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/07/googledrive-2-0-0/) and [googlesheets4 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/07/googlesheets4-1-0-0/)), we thought it might be helpful to see how the two packages can be used together in a "real-world" scenario.

Here, I'll be using downloaded Excel data on the modern pentathlon, uploading it to Google Drive as a Google Sheet, reading it into R, and modifying the spreadsheet Google Drive by adding a tidied version of that data as a new sheet/tab.

```{r libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(googledrive)
library(googlesheets4)
```

## Authenticating and uploading

First thing's first, I'll to upload the `.xls` file from  [Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) 2021 Pentathlon World Championships](https://www.uipmworld.org/event/uipm-2021-pentathlon-world-championships) to Google Drive.

To authenticate with my Google Drive account (and specify which one I want to use), I'll use [`googledrive::drive_auth()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_auth.html), which allows you to either interactively select a pre-authorized account in R, or takes you to the browser to generate obtain a new token for your account. I'll also (unnecessarily) specify [`googlesheets4::gs4_auth()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_auth.html), just so you can see what that function looks like as well. 

To learn more about authenticating your account in an R Markdown document, see the [Non-interactive auth](https://gargle.r-lib.org/articles/non-interactive-auth.html#sidebar-2-i-just-want-my-rmd-to-render) article for [{gargle}](https://gargle.r-lib.org/).

```{r drive-auth}
drive_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
gs4_auth(email = "mara@rstudio.com")
```

Now I can upload the Excel file to my Google Drive as a spreadsheet using [`googledrive::drive_upload()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_upload.html). If I don't specify the `type` argument, a MIME type is automatically determined from the file extension. I'm using the `overwrite` argument here to avoid clogging my Google Drive with this same data over and over, since I've knit this document several times.

```{r upload-file-basic}
drive_upload(
  media = "Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships.xls",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

However, I can also specify a type (e.g. `type = "spreadsheet"`), which will convert the file to its Google equivalent (in this case, a Google Sheet) if the source file is a compatible type. Note that I'll also get a message telling me what file has been trashed by the `overwrite` argument. In this case, it should match the id for the upload I did in the previous chunk.

```{r upload-as-sheet}
drive_upload(
  media = "Competition_Results_Exports_UIPM_2021_Pentathlon_World_Championships.xls",
  type = "spreadsheet",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

## Finding and getting the data into R

Now, let's say I want to read my sheet into R to do some data wrangling (it's about as untidy as a dataset can get). I'll use [`googledrive::drive_find()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_find.html) to find the sheet I want by name or keyword.

```{r drive-find}
drive_find("Pentathlon")
```
Since I know which one I want, I can retrieve the sheet by `id` with [`googledrive::drive_get()`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/drive_get.html).

```{r drie-get}
pentathlon_ss <- drive_get(id = "1W5Y46CAMjpvnqOtPIzA48hmCJElb6vKE1-Vo8v2jj_4")
```

To actually read the file into R as a data frame, we'll need googlesheets4. We can use [`googlesheets4::gs4_get()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/gs4_get.html) to see all of the sheets available within our spreadsheet. 

```{r gs4}
gs4_get(pentathlon_ss)
```
Let's say we want the "Women Finals" results. We can pipe the results of `gs4_get()` into [`googlesheets4::read_sheet()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/range_read.html) to read that specific sheet into R as a data frame. In this case, the sheets are all names (thanks to to UIPM's meticulous record keeping), so I'll specify the `sheet` argument as a string. However, you can also specify the `sheet` by position (e.g. 6, in the case of the sheet I want here). If `sheet` is not specified, `read_sheet()` will default to the first visible sheet.

```{r read-sheet}
w_finals <- gs4_get(pentathlon_ss) %>%
  read_sheet(sheet = "Women Finals")
```

```{r glimpse-w-finals}
glimpse(w_finals)
```

## Adding and writing to the spreadsheet

As you can probably see from this `glimpse()` at the data above, it is most definitely _not_ tidy. If you want to see how I went about cleaning it up and/or learn more about the sport of modern pentathlon, you can check out the episode of [Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/ellis_hughes)
and [Patrick Wardâ€™s](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick) [TidyX Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP8l94xtoemCH_GxByvTuFQ),  [Episode 69 | Modern Pentathlons with Mara Averick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1356s1-as4o), and find all of the code in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/batpigandme/modern-pentathlon).

For the purposes of this post, suffice it to say that cleaning was done, resulting in a tidy data frame called `women_finals_tidy`.

```{r tidy-women-finals, echo=FALSE}
women_finals_tidy <- w_finals %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate("name", into = c("name", "uipm_id"), sep = "\n") %>%
  separate("uipm_id", into = c("uipm_id", "dob"), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("fencing", into = c("fencing_pts", "f_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_pos", "f_rest"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_wins", "f_rest"), sep = " V - ") %>%
  separate("f_rest", into = c("fencing_losses", NA), sep = " ") %>%
  separate("swimming", into = c("swim_pts", "s_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("s_rest", into = c("swim_pos", "swim_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("riding", into = c("riding_pts", "r_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("r_rest", into = c("riding_pos", "riding_score"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  separate("laser_run", into = c("laser_run_pts", "lr_rest"), sep = ' \\(') %>%
  separate("lr_rest", into = c("lr_pos", "lr_time"), sep = '\\)\n') %>%
  mutate(across(ends_with("pts") | ends_with("pos") | starts_with("fencing") | starts_with("riding"), readr::parse_double)) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = readr::parse_number(time_difference)) %>%
  mutate(dob = readr::parse_date(dob, "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  mutate(time_difference = replace_na(time_difference, 0)) %>%
  separate(lr_time, into = c("lr_mins", "lr_secs"), sep = ":", remove = FALSE) %>%
  mutate(lr_mins = lubridate::dminutes(as.numeric(lr_mins))) %>%
  mutate(across(c("lr_secs", "time_difference"), lubridate::dseconds)) %>%
  mutate(lr_secs = lr_mins + lr_secs) %>%
  mutate(finish_time = lr_secs + time_difference) %>%
  select(-lr_mins)
```

```{r glimpse-tidy-finals}
glimpse(women_finals_tidy)
```

To add this back to our original spreadsheet, we'll use two functions: [`googlesheets4::sheet_add()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/sheet_add.html) to add a new named sheet to our existing spreadsheet, and [`googlesheets4::sheet_write()`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/reference/sheet_write.html) to write our data into that sheet.

Without a `sheet` argument, `sheet_add()` would create a new sheet in the specified file as "SheetN", but I'll specify the argument to call it "Tidy Women Finals". Since I want the sheet to be put at the end of the workbook (which is the default behaviour), I am not going to specify an argument for `.before` or `.after`.

```{r add-sheet}
sheet_add(pentathlon_ss, sheet = "Tidy Women Finals")
```

Now we'll actually write the data frame from R into that tab with `write_sheet()`.

```{r write-sheet}
write_sheet(women_finals_tidy, 
            ss = pentathlon_ss, 
            sheet = "Tidy Women Finals")
```

To see if that worked, we can use `gs4_get()` again to show us the tabs in our workbook:

```{r gs4-get-again}
gs4_get(pentathlon_ss)
```

If you're a very astute observer, you may be wondering why the dimensions of the "Tidy Women Finals" do not look exactly the same as our `women_finals_tidy` data frame. This is because `sheet_write()` styles the target sheet as a table, which means that the column names become the first/header row, conveniently frozen for your scrolling pleasure.

![Tidy Women Finals tab of UIPM World Championships Google Sheets workbook with first row showing column names](https://i.imgur.com/0X0Ame2.png)

```{r delete-sheet, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# deleting the Tidy Women Finals sheet so that it doesn't exist
# when I go to knit this file again
sheet_delete(pentathlon_ss, sheet = "Tidy Women Finals")
```

## Fin

Success! We've added our tidy data frame to the original data we uploaded to Google Drive.
